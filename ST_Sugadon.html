<h1>Springtrap Sugadon</h1>    

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Sugar runs out of sausages so she goes into the meat freezer to get some with Landon, but Springtrap is alive and he traps them both, soon breaking Sugar's paw and grabbing onto her strings, causing her to scream in pain. Soon later Landon gets caught up in the fight and Springtrap tries to choke him, but Sugar goes berserk and soon knocks him out, before they head home and Sugar passes out. Landon soon deals with her and Sugar suddenly asks Landon out, to which he said yes, much to Bonnie's amusement as he listened in on Landon's phone sercretly.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>As the chefs plan for the birthday party in the next day Sugar goes to get some more sausage from the meat freezer with Landon, only to find it is somehow stuck down and she cannot pick it up. Suddenly the door slams shut and they are both trapped with Springtrap, who starts talking about how desperate Sugar is to see her 'old friend', to which she obviously denies. Sugar then threatens him, her strings appearing in self defence as she stares at Springtrap. Landon suggests fighting him and Sugar does so, shifting into a wolf and ripping his one good rabbit ear off.</p>

<p>Springtrap pays no mind and he suddenly grabs her paw, gripping it so tightly it breaks. Sugar struggles against his grip and Landon tries to help her to no avail, much to the sadistic amusement of Springtrap. She tries to push him away with her strings as self defence when Springtrap drops her paw but grabs her strings instead, holding her in an iron grip as she tries to escape, but it hurts too much to go too far, so Landon tries to help her, at her request, by throwing a box onto Springtrap (or attempting) as he yells "Let go of her strings!! If you tear them I'm gonna kill you!" but he doesn't drop the box since Springtrap gets an idea and yanks on Sugar's strings, causing one to rip which makes her scream out in pain and terror.</p>

<p>Landon eventually throws the box but Springtrap barely reacts, causing Sugar to break down and just collapse on the floor. Springtrap then drops Sugar's strings, so she tries to escape but realises the door is too thick to be unlocked. He pushes himself to his feet and towers over Landon, who backs up against a wall. Springtrap then says, "Now watch old friend, as you witness the best kind of pain, seeing what you love being taken from you" before he grabs Landon by the neck, lifting him up and choking him as Landon struggles against him.</p>

<p>Sugar suddenly just..sees red and she starts beating up Springtrap with her stronger hand, pinning him down with her strings as she just goes berserk and beats Springtrap up in a fit of rage from seeing him hurt Landon. She soon knocks him out and she stumbles out of the freezer now the door is unlocked and she falls to the ground, so Landon helps her as he watches her with a concerned expression since he heard her screams of pain. They soon rush out of the pizzaria after talking to the animatronics and of course locking the door and going home.</p>

<p>Sugar passes out so Landon has to give her a healing cookie but when he eventually did, she woke up and they hugged tightly which hurt her hand but her strings were fixed, so a lot of her pain was relieved. Sugar then finally confessed to Landon and asked him to be her boyfriend, to which he happily replied yes. They had a happy moment before it was rudely cut short by Bonnie, who was teasing them both since he had put a wiretap on Landon's phone. They tease him back and he soon hangs up, before Sugar tells Landon to put his phone in her garage which he happily does. They then play a game for FNaF, only for Sugar to lose in shock since Landon kisses her on the lips to distract her. Sugar loses the bet so she has to tell Eren what happened, and they soon cuddle again, falling asleep next to each other as the credits of Big Hero 6 roll by on the screen.</p>

<h2>Alternate Endings/Turnout</h2>
<p>Landon's death:  During the fight, Springtrap pulls Landon up and starts to choke him in his tight grip. Alternatively, Sugar sits in shock, watching them as she's frozen in terror. After a few moments of struggling, Landon croakily calls out to Sugar to help him, before falling limp in Springtrap's arms, Dead. Sugar finally snaps back to her senses and she goes into a rage, pushing herself to her feet and starting to beat up Springtrap, too overwhelmed by emotions to do anything but fight as Springtrap falls in shock. He soon gets knocked out, leaving Sugar the only one..Alive in a sense. She falls back against the wall and she stares at Landon's body slumped next to her. The adrenaline soon fades and she realises the weight of the situation, making her tear up and start to sob as she stares at her friend's dead, or..deader body. She shakily holds her arms out and pulls him towards her, picking him up in a bridal type hold as she stands up.</p>

<p>She tries to ignore the immense pain from both her ripped string/s and her broken hand and she stumbles towards the door, leaning against it as her sobs echo around the meat freezer. She weakly kicks the door open and walks out of the freezer, slamming it shut behind her before she walks to the dining room. The animatronics are watching the kitchen with 'concerned' expressions, before a flurry of robotic gasps can be heard as they rush over to her. Chica looks down at Landon in 'shock', tilting her robotic head "Is he..?" The only movement seen is a nod, before Sugar's sobs seemed to get louder, only a moment later does she takes a shaky breath and try to calm herself down. She tells the animatronics to not worry, and she soon exists the pizzaria, walking home with Landon in her arms.</p>
