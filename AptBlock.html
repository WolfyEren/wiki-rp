<h1>Apartment Block (aka Basement Apartments)</h1>    

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>A whole apartment-like complex built underneath Sugar's house (possibly by Eren or a construction crew beforehand). Alyssa, Sammy, Luna, Grace, Jenny, Crystal, Kyle, Min, and Marie live here.</p>

<h2>Layout</h2>
<p>After arriving from the stairs, there's a long hallway with rooms on both sides. Min's room is the first and only apartment on the left. Marie's room is the first apartment on the right. Sammy, Luna, and Grace's apartment is the second door on the right. Alyssa, Jenny, Crystal, and Kyle's apartment is the 3rd door on the right. There are other unoccupied rooms that has yet to be filled. But it probably won't fill up anytime soon. Might have some test/experiments planned in the future >_></p>
