<p>In the aftermath of Jenny and Jay doing pranks together, Jenny swaps Sugar's healing cookies with her harmful ones. As Sugar and Landon test her string strength her string rips, so in turn she goes home to try a healing cookie to recover. But since they were swapped she had a harming cookie without realising and she soon got a splitting headache and she threw up, before passing out (hitting her head on the sink in the process) in the bathroom as Landon waited in the garage for her.</p>
 
<p>After Landon finds her he promptly calls an ambulance and she gets taken to hospital, soon fully hooked up to the machines. She seems almost dead to the outside world, but in her dreams she doesn't even realise she is dreaming. She goes downstairs to make a healing serum with Landon but the mood turns sour as he starts insulting her, before eventually shoving her against the wall and trying to strangle her. She of course fights back with her strings, but in this nightmare dream world her strings seem to have a mind of their own and when Landon tries to throw a wrench at her afte she pins him to the ground, her strings fight back and they pin his arms down, plus using the wrench to hit him across the head as more strings strangle him. Sugar is obviously very shocked and she is trying to stop her strings, but to no avail as Landon soon eventually just..dies on the floor. Sugar is obviously very shaken and she stares at his corpse, unaware she is only dreaming since she thinks she has actually killed him.</p>
