<h2>Relationships (Based on Strongest)</h2>
<p><strong>Kakage(Ven) (Positive) </strong></p>
<p>They aren't what you say friends, but business partners in a way. Kakage has..donated Anne towards her..business and he has also given Lucille lots of money towards bringing Sugar and Valentine to her ship for 'entertainment'. They now argue finances together in death. Sike</p>

<p><strong>Nicholas (Neutral)</strong></p>
<p>Is one of her 'colleagues', and she seems 'friendly' with him solely because he seemed passionate about getting Sugar and making her a dancer for the ship, considering his past experiences with her. </p>
    
 <p><strong>Sugar (Negative) </strong></p>
<p>Befriended Sugar in attempt to convince her to come to the ship (which eventually worked) and then use her for enteratainment, but namely because of Kakage since he paid Lucille to get her to come. They seemed to almost be good friends at the start before the betrayal, until of course Sugar lost complete trust in her.</p>   
    
 <p><strong>Anne (Neutral) </strong></p>
<p>One of the servers at the club that Kakage brought in. Was quite nice to her considering she was influencing her into a state of mind control.</p>   
    
 <p><strong>Alyssa (Neutral) </strong></p>
<p>Is another one of the 'dancers' that Lucille was aiming to get for the ship. She gained her trust by talking about acting with her, and influencing her to come to the club. When they eventually get onto the ship, Lucille doesn't bother removing the influence once on the ship, so Alyssa stays dancing throughout the events that happen on the ship.</p>   
    
 <p><strong>Gorge (Neutral) </strong></p>
<p>Is one of her 'colleagues', although she doesn't care about him and only uses him for his revival powers.</p>   
    
 <p><strong>Terrin (Neutral) </strong></p>
<p>Is one of her 'colleagues', but she doesn't care about her since Terrin seems to hate Lucille, only staying because of Mason and because she gets to mess around with and tease the dancers.</p>   
    
 <p><strong>Mason (Neutral) </strong></p>
<p>Is one of her 'colleagues' but she doesn't care about him since he doesn't care about her and he's only there because she forces him to stay since Gorge brought him back to life and he has no where else to go.</p>   
    
<p><strong>Landon (Negative) </strong></p>
<p>Doesn't know him besides he's Sugars boyfriend and they're very close. Attempts to try to convince Sugar he cheated on her, which causes him to go beserk when he finds out and kills Lucille. Not exactly on best terms.</p>
