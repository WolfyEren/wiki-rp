<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p><strong>Eren</strong></p>
<p>Eren is Valentine's closest friend since her childhood. They met when she stuck up for Eren against kids that were bullying him for being a werewolf. Since then they've maintained a good friendship up until graduation when Eren somehow went missing. Val was however too busy with trying to pursue her career as a Private Investigator to notice that he went missing (Ironic). She instead thought that Eren had to move or some situation had come up where he couldn't remain in contact with her anymore. 5 years later, much to her surprise she ends up reuniting with Eren after her mail got sent to the wrong Sugar as both her and Eren were overjoyed to see eachother again, both not knowing what really happened to each other. (More to come later)</p>
