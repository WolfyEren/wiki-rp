<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>A confident detective who believes in her skills and abilities.</p>

<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p><strong>Eren</strong></p>
<p>Eren is Valentine's closest friend since her childhood. They met when she stuck up for Eren against kids that were bullying him for being a werewolf. Since then they've maintained a good friendship up until graduation when Eren somehow went missing. Val was however too busy with trying to pursue her career as a Private Investigator to notice that he went missing (Ironic). She instead thought that Eren had to move or some situation had come up where he couldn't remain in contact with her anymore. 5 years later, much to her surprise she ends up reuniting with Eren after her mail got sent to the wrong Sugar as both her and Eren were overjoyed to see eachother again, both not knowing what really happened to each other. (More to come later)</p>

<p><strong>Luna</strong></p>
<p>Luna is Valentine's other close friend from high school. They were apart of a friend group that consisted of Her, Eren, and Luna. Once graduation rolled up, the group ended up disbanding after Valentine pursued her career as a detective and underwent police training. 5 years later, she's convinced by Eren to look for Luna and they eventually do, much to her happy surprise. After they reunite, they all drink together (after some deals), both her and Luna get drunk together and playfully tease each other while Eren just kinda awkwardly is in the background. When not wrapped up in the head of things, she will be concerned for Luna and try to deny any attempts at drinking (although she can be nudged to it).</p>

<p><strong>Sugar</strong></p>
<p>Sugar is a good friend of Valentine. She oftens confides to her for help with any problems she has with Eren, most notablely when she feels bad for "betraying" Eren. </p>

<p><strong>Ally</strong></p>
<p>Ally is the kid sister to Valentine and daughter of Valerie. Is often manipulative of Val but only because she's hardly home all the time, not making out with Eren or solving cases of the man behind the slaughter.</p> 

<p><strong>Sandy</strong></p>
<p>The Secretary who works at the same Police Department as her. Val is one of the very few people who talk to her and considers her as a friend after the whole incident with the inmate breaking out.</p>

<p><strong>Jackson</strong></p>
<p>A fellow cop coworker who works at the RPD alongside Val. They have been partners in several cases together and make a good duo. He often socializes with her during shifts and they are quite friendly towards each other.</p>

<p><strong>Valerie</strong></p>
<p>Valerie is Valentine's mother. Was entrusted with Ally after they moved out, wonder why, maybe try asking her about it.</p>

<p><strong>Landon</strong></p>
<p>Valentine doesn't really care for Landon as he oftens antagonizes Eren which she dislikes and gets mad at him about.</p>

<p><strong>Nick</strong></p>
<p>Secret Character :eyes:</p>

<p><strong>Ven</strong></p>
<p>Hates his guts for when he tried to kill all of her friends and herself. Also when he kidnapped her and Eren and essentially tortured them via physical and mental trauma. Glad that he's dead.</p>
