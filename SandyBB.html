<p>Status: Sister</p>
<p>How they met: Growing up together</p>
<p>Personal Sentiments: Life was hard growing up and didn't get easier for the two girls as they got older but they learned to cope. After Sallie signed up to the..program, they managed to move somewhere nice and even though work was (in Sandy's words) 'a chore', they were happy. Now Briggs is gone, work is no longer a chore and they spent lots of time together.</p>
<p>Extras: Even though Sallie doesn't really understand her, she's happy to have her sister.</p>
