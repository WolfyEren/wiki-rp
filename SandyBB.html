<h2>Biography</h2>
<p><strong>Early Life</strong></p>
<p>Growing up, Sandy didn't fit in. She didn't understand the other kids and their jokes, and she was always 'the fat one'. But she didn't let it phase her and she excelled at school which gave her enough qualifications to get a job after Sallie recommended the RPD.</p>

<p><strong>Plot Life</strong></p>
<p>Sandy has been involved in a few plots. Her biggest involvement was during Chief, where she saved Eren and Val's life at the last moment, later on managing to overpower the Ox Ortho Briggs. She testified against him in court, and provided crucial proof of his crimes. Since then, she's helped Val recover from her triggers from Brigg's and she's been on the side. She had a small plot where Eren and Val turned her into a dog, but Sandy is happy about that. She can talk to her doggies all day and now they can talk back. Recently, Sandy had the spotlight after one cursed evening when Sebastian attempted to kill her. But once again, she is on the side and she's content.</p>
