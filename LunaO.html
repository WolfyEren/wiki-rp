<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p><strong>Valentine</strong></p>
<p>A close friend of Luna's. She likes her for her confident and direct approach to things as well as her cute red hair. Was overwhelmed when she saw the two of them at their place after so many years, instantly hugging them both. She's surprised by Val's new furryness and thinks that they look good as werewolves, still appalled by her ears and tail. While drunk, she stays in close contact with Val as they stuck together like fleas to a dog and teased each other in their drunken state, getting a bit hands on at times.</p>

<p><strong>Eren</strong></p>
<p>A close friend to Luna. She likes him for his calm and thoughtful take on things and tries to make him feel better about his werewolf side by saying it's cute and that other people are just jealous. Was overwhelmed when she saw the two of them just standing outside her door after 5 years, instantly pulling them into a group hug. She still teases Eren with jokes after all that time as a way to keep things less awkward. While drunk, she kept "encouraging" Eren to drink and to catch up with them, otherwise he's a wuss.</p>
