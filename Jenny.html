<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>A werewolf orphan who was often bullied by other kids. Sugar found her and introduced her to Eren since he's also a natural born werewolf and he taught her, eventually adopting her although she's mainly under Alyssa's care. She is also adoptive siblings with Crystal and Kyle</p>

<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p><strong>Eren (Postive)</strong></p>
<p>Jenny's unofficial adoptive Wolf Dad although he's usually busy with the adventures that he goes on to fully watch over/take care of her. He does often bring her back gifts and trinkets from them which make up for it. Eren also paid child support for her.</p>

<p><strong>Alyssa (Positive)</strong></p>
<p>Jenny's maternal Caretaker who mainly watches over her everyday alongside Crystal and Kyle. She's usually a target of the children's antics, especially now with Jay's influence on Jenny although she's learning to keep a close eye over them.</p>

<p><strong>Jay (Positive)</strong></p>
<p>Jenny's accomplice in crime. She knows she's the real mastermind and that Jay is just going along with it though.</p>

<p>Valentine's little sister who she hangs out with a lot. She considers her an actual friend, she likes playing games with her and making plans to get Eren and Val together (she has realised Alyssa and Eren are a lost cause), but she'd still steal the last pizza slice from her.</p>
    
<p><strong>Sugar (Positive)</strong></p>
<p>Sugar often lets Jenny hangout and play games in the living room if it gets too crowded with the rest of her family</p>
