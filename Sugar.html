They ended up connecting and started hanging out where Landon soon became apart of the group's antics that changed his life forever. Mainly because he's a vampire now. But it's not like he sees the sun on a normal basis. They are quite close considering they are dating now, and they've saved each others lives a few times so they're kinda stuck with each other.</p>
