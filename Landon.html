<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>An epic gamer who didn't really do much besides hanging out with his best friend Bonnie.</p>

<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p><strong>Bonnie (Positive) </strong></p>
<p>Landon's best friend since high school. They often hang out together and play games. Although they hang out less often ever since Landon found himself a lady friend</p>

<img src="images/SUGADON.jpg" width="500" height="500">
<p><strong>Sugar (Positive) </strong></p>
<p>Landon's girlfriend. She's one of the only people who puts up with his antics and she has saved his life a few times so he's stuck with her. Is also his 'gaming setup' aka a lap to rest his head on when they play games. They are extremely comfortable together, and don't get them drunk unless you are okay with watching two hormonal people get at each other with no inhibitions.</p>

<p><strong>Mason (Neutral) </strong></p>
<p>He's the vampire Landon fought on the ship (who also made him gay panic since he was shirtless but that's not important) who then slashed his wing and offered to train him in the 'vampire ways' in trade for his life when Landon had him held over the ships railing over the seas below.</p>
    
<p><strong>Valentine (Negative) </strong></p>
<p>Dislikes Val since she often gets annoyed at his remarks about Eren even if he states "It's all in good fun"</p>

<p><strong>Eren (Negative) </strong></p>
<p>Hates Eren for some reason.</p>
    
<p><strong>Lucille (Negative) </strong></p>
<p>Not much is known about Lucille from Landon's point of view except she kidnapped Sugar, forced her to dance, shocked her and tried to convince her that he cheated on her. So of course Landon had to kill her in a very..vampire-esqe way. Safe to say Landon hates her guts.</p>
