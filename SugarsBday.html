<h1>Sugar's Bday</h1> 
    
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>After Eren makes her pancakes, Sugar and Eren head to the pizzeria to "meet the health inspector". Turns out it's actually Sugar's birthday, and Val, Landon, Eren, The animatronics and even Min all pitched in to celebrate! They all have fun playing some games after Min brings out the cake and Sugar and Landon leave to "cuddle" before they stop by the skate park to get Landon's wallet, before they realise Ven's body is gone, only his blood stain to show what happened. They head home, of course a little shaken and Sugar calls Eren so Eren and Valentine can go investigate the skate park properly and well..it's not the brightest birthday Sugar has had. </p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Sugar wakes up to a call from Eren who tells her it is a 'very important day' so Sugar assumes the health inspector is coming since she has forgotten it's her birthday due to the events of last week (Puppetmaster plot). He tells her to come downstairs so she does, obviously quite tired since 10am is of course too early to wake up. She realises Eren made pancakes for her and she eats them happily, still unaware it is her birthday. When she is done he tidies up and they get ready to go to the pizzeria.</p>

<p>They bond a little on the way to the pizzeria before they arrive, Sugar waiting in the lobby after Eren tells her too. She rushes through as soon as she hears a scream, before the lights turn on to reveal the pizzeria decked out for her birthday, with everyone from Landon to the animatronics wearing their own special party hats. Of course, Sugar is given one too since she is the birthday girl. She is obviously very pleased and quickly relaxes into the party, or..more so into Landon's arms.</p>    
    
<p>After a few minutes, Min suddenly brings out the cake as she meekly sings Happy Birthday to Sugar as all the others join in. Well, everyone except Landon who just wants a slice of cake. And Chica, who is also too busy looking at the cake to sing. When Sugar makes her wish, they all take a slice and enjoy the cake Min baked for Sugar, chatting happily as they do so. Apart from the animatronics of course, they can't eat to start with.</p>
