<h1>Sugar's Bday</h1> 
    
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>After Eren makes her pancakes, Sugar and Eren head to the pizzeria to "meet the health inspector". Turns out it's actually Sugar's birthday, and Val, Landon, Eren, The animatronics and even Min all pitched in to celebrate! They all have fun playing some games after Min brings out the cake and Sugar and Landon leave to "cuddle" before they stop by the skate park to get Landon's wallet, before they realise Ven's body is gone, only his blood stain to show what happened. They head home, of course a little shaken and Sugar calls Eren so Eren and Valentine can go investigate the skate park properly and well..it's not the brightest birthday Sugar has had. </p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Sugar wakes up to a call from Eren who tells her it is a 'very important day' so Sugar assumes the health inspector is coming since she has forgotten it's her birthday due to the events of last week (Puppetmaster plot). He tells her to come downstairs so she does, obviously quite tired since 10am is of course too early to wake up. She realises Eren made pancakes for her and she eats them happily, still unaware it is her birthday. When she is done he tidies up and they get ready to go to the pizzeria.</p>

<p>They bond a little on the way to the pizzeria before they arrive, Sugar waiting in the lobby after Eren tells her too. She rushes through as soon as she hears a scream, before the lights turn on to reveal the pizzeria decked out for her birthday, with everyone from Landon to the animatronics wearing their own special party hats. Of course, Sugar is given one too since she is the birthday girl. She is obviously very pleased and quickly relaxes into the party, or..more so into Landon's arms.</p>    
    
<p>After a few minutes, Min suddenly brings out the cake as she meekly sings Happy Birthday to Sugar as all the others join in. Well, everyone except Landon who just wants a slice of cake. And Chica, who is also too busy looking at the cake to sing. When Sugar makes her wish, they all take a slice and enjoy the cake Min baked for Sugar, chatting happily as they do so. Apart from the animatronics of course, they can't eat to start with.</p>    
    
<p>After they eat, Eren tells the animatronics to go to separate locations around the pizzeria, causing Sugar to be incredibly confused. After a bit, Eren walks up onto stage with one of Freddy's spare top hats and microphone, announcing to everyone: "Ladies and..man, welcome to tonights game show..Truth or Dare-Questionaire, Sugar edition"</p>
    
<p>After majority rules with Val and Sugar to hear the rules, Eren asks Sugar to come up on stage to demonstrate how the game works, and up onto stage she goes. Eren explains that she has to ask a question about herself to someone, and they have to get it right. If they do, it's a forced truth or dare for Sugar. IF they get it wrong, it's a forced truth or dare for whoever was asked instead. Sugar understands it pretty quickly so she starts with asking Landon.</p>    
    
<p>She starts off simple for Landon, asking simply "who's my favourite person to play in Five Nights with Friends?" but of course Landon knows the answer so he says "Nightguard", which is correct. In tern, Sugar asks for Truth so Landon asks "Out of the animatronics, who do you dislike the most" so Sugar replies "Chica, she keeps shoving her face in my business" honestly, causing Val to compare Chica to Ally.</p>   
    
<p>The next person Sugar asks is Eren, with the simple question of "What was the one issue Chica used to have that I had to keep constantly fixing with her old suit?" but of course, being the other owner he knows the answer and replies in relief with "Her old beak kept falling off, now that she has a new suit and new beak, it's been pretty sturdy since." Which means Sugar picks dare and Landon jumps in to dare her to insult Eren aorund Foxy while wearing a Bonnie head, but since they recognise her voice that was a bust so Landon dared her to slap Eren, or to Insult him. She 'slaps' him, basically patting his cheek since 'you didn't say how hard'. Eren plays along, and Landon's annoyed but that's a dare done for Sugar. </p> 
    
<p>Sugar then turns to Val, asking her "What is the name of my animal crossing island" which surprisingly Val gets wrong with the reply of "Flower-Town" so Val gets a dare to kiss Eren. But Eren quickly hops in to say that he didn't make any rules on technical workarounds so he says she should lick his cheek as a wolf as a technical kiss. Val complies, shifting quickly to lick his totally not slightly blushing cheek when Eren kneels down next to her and they both part quickly, Val shifting human again.</p>    
    
<p>Sugar quickly moves to the next question, knowing that Landon will fail as she asks "When did Marie die?" to which he replies "from the bite of 87?" which is wrong so Landon picks truth, causing Sugar to ask "What was the most embarrassing moment of your life? Explain in great detail please." which then makes Landon think intensely for a while, you could almost hear the cogs grinding in his brain before he starts talking about a story where he went to a college campus with Bonnie and one of the speakers was a cow mystic with just a deep voice, but Landon being the idiot he is accidentally called her mister when looking for the bathroom and he ended it with "she may have been a cow but she could definitely hit like a bull" which seems to even cause him some good old phantom pain as he rubs his side.</p>
