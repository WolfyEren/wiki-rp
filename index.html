<h1>Home page I guess?</h1>    
<p>Does anybody even check this without me having to say I updated it? What if I go missing, you could use this a clue to see that I'm still alive even if I'm supposedely "gone". Maybe. Also Sugar is soon gonna learn how to edit the wiki so both of us will be able to work on it. Hoorah.</p>    

<h1>Have any questions?</h1>
<p>If you want to ask anything then go on the link below and it will take you to a google form. I sadly can't figure out external output on here so we'll just have to work with this. Thank you for the two people who know about this and answered it.</p>

<p><strong>"Where are the Mystics that are animals related to water? Is that even allowed? Maybe they're just hiding underwater? Can I have a frog, or a squid? Maybe even a turtle!"</strong></p>
<p>I'll have to check >_>, I mean there probably are and you can check if you ever move in to replay. I'll give you a talking frog that always does a peace sign. The turtles are already taken unfortantely.</p>
