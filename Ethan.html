He's seen many prisoners come and go and his own freedom was promised after he kept a streak of not drinking any alcohol.</p>
<p>But late september, he was assaulted and now sports a white mask to hide his face. Don't ask him what's underneath, he won't answer.</p>

<p><strong>Sebastian [Strongly Negative]</strong></p>
<p>He didn't talk to Sebastian much when the man was in jail. He wasn't interested in an unoriginal wannabee who didn't even come up with his own costume. But late september, their relationship changed to hatred on one night. Sebastian broke free and manipulated Ethan, before assaulting him with lasting injuries.</p>

<p><strong>Luke [Slightly Positive]</strong></p>
<p>He is annoyed by Luke's talk of love and incessant teasing. But after Luke has fled from jail, he kind of misses seeing the weird wolf man spinning in circles chasing his tail. He'd never admit it, though.</p>
   
<p><strong>Mason [Neutral]</strong></p>
<p>Works together as bodyguards although the two do butt heads at times. Has long since forgotten about the vampire since he has a new blond to hate.</p>

<p><strong>Lucille [Neutral]</strong></p>
<p>She was his employer and she paid him. Now neighbours in the RPD jail cells, their small talk has long grown dry.</p>
 
<p><strong>Kakage/Ven [Neutral]</strong></p>
<p>He was frequently called on by Ven to do menial tasks that Ethan would rather not do. Now he just sees Kakage when he visits his wife, Lucille. Kakage doesn't talk to him, so he doesn't try to talk back.</p>
