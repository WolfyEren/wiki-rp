<h2>Relationships (Based on Strongest)</h2>
<p><strong>Mason (Positive) </strong></p>
<p>Very Close Vampire "Buddies"</p>

<p><strong>Lucille (Neutral) </strong></p>
<p>Tolerated her since she offered her a free place to live in as well as free food. Didn't really care all too much that she died as there were more pressing issues like being arrested.</p>

<p><strong>Eren (Neutral) </strong></p>
<p>Annoyed that he won't fight back and therefore can't kill him. Decided to let him live since he wanted to die which was weird to her.</p>    

<p><strong>Nicholas (Neutral) </strong></p>
<p>Didn't interact much aside from her telling them to get out after he pestered on about how they're a group and have to stick together and plan stuff.</p>

<p><strong>Gorge (Neutral) </strong></p>
<p>Likes to mess with him occasionally but doesnt really care about him aside for his revival powers. Decides to ditch him after he refused to come with them on the boat.</p>

<p><strong>Kakage (Negative) </strong></p>
<p>Dislikes him due to being a bother and annoyance to her and Mason. Glad he's dead but wished she killed him first.</p>
