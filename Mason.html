Meanwhile Terrin absolutely hates the hell out of him after he drugged her and took advantage of her, and this was after he also abandoned her at the Bank Heist job.</p>
<p>Extras: Terrin shot him in the end, seemingly ending it all, until his body mysteriously disappeared when the police arrived.</p>
