<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>Jay's brother who was revealed to be a vampire when he tried to "sacrifice" Jay which is when Grace managed to kill him. Was on the ship and attacked Landon, before he managed to escape with Terrin, turning her into a vampire in the process. Time passed, they robbed a bank together and he went money/poer hungry. He eventually raped Terrin one night and she left, causing him to encounter Lucille and co once more. He worked at the club and kidnapped Grace, brainwashing her to replace Terrin, and turning her into a vampire. After Terrin saw him again, she shot him in the head. Presumed dead.</p>

<h2>Relationships (Based on Strongest)</h2>
<p><strong>Terrin (Very Negative) </strong></p>
<p>Keep them away from each other in all senses. Vampire "buddies" until they robbed a bank together, he raped her and she ran away and then he stalked her apartment then she got her revenge and shot him in the head. Ouch.</p>

<p><strong>Jay (Negative) </strong></p>
<p>Brotherly bond, so much that he'll kill him and then try to turn him into a vampire.</p>

<p><strong>Grace (Negative) </strong></p>
<p>"I'm gonna bite her, kill her, then revive her so I can kill her all over again." Also turned her into a vampire and a mindslave. As you do.</p>

<p><strong>Eren (Negative) </strong></p>
<p>Blames for Terrin leaving her, if Mason saw him, he'd KOS if he wasn't too busy simping for his ex (who he raped btw)</p>
    
<p><strong>Kakage (Negative) </strong></p>
<p>Stay away from them.</p>

<p><strong>Landon (Negative) </strong></p>
<p>Fellow vampire. Tried to kill each other after Mason saw Landon on the ship, and he got the jump on him as he slashed the others wing before Landon suddenly got the upper hand and managed to hold Mason over the ships edge above the water, making him quickly bargain for his "life" by offering to train him as a vampire. Also made him gay panic. Then he also had to stop him from completely sucking Lucille dry of blood once he killed her. They trained together for some time until they stopped, and Landon hasn't seen him properly since.</p>    

<p><strong>Lucille (Negative) </strong></p>
<p>A 'colleague' of hers. Only sticks around because he's forced to. Would happily kill her if Landon hadn't already.</p>

<p><strong>Gorge (Negative) </strong></p>
<p>The one that brought him back to life after being killed by Grace. Doesn't care about him and leaves him behind on the ship as him and Terrin go to escape. Has no idea if he's "alive"(in a skeleton way) or not and doesn't care either way.</p>
