<h1>Puppetmaster</h1>    

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>After Sugar goes home from the pizzeria a mystic magazine interviewer shows up to the door, soon interviewing her. The day after Eren gets interviewed too, but Sugar and Eren both get slightly suspicious of "Ven", the interviewer. The day after that Sugar and Landon are in the skate park, before they both get kidnapped and trapped in deadly springlock suits. Eren and Val manage to find them and get at least Sugar out, before a mysterious voice causes them to investigate before getting Landon out, soon getting caught up in a life threatening fight as Ven now uses Sugar to try to kill Eren and in turn Val, before attempting to use her for his genocide plans for the city. After Sugar chokes Eren, which in turn makes Ven choke Val Eren breaks free and starts attacking Ven face on, before he stabs his claws through his throat and starts slashing his face repeatedly until he's not recognisable. After Sugar breaks free she quickly goes and gets Landon out of his springlocks, bringing him back to the others when they're done. After Landon empties his stomach in the street they all head home (Eren passed out in Val's arms) and when Eren wakes up Sugar tells him what happened, but at least he's dead, right?</p>
