<h2>Biography</h2>
<p><strong>Early Life</strong></p>
<p>Ever since she was born, her parents have been trying to raise her to be the "Perfect Daughter".

This small taste eventually spiraled downhill as Julie became more and more confident in herself in fighting back against her parent's wishes until they finally had enough, firing the tutor and doubling down on all lessons which were now personally monitored by her Father, slowly draining any sign of hope or thoughts of freedom from her mind as the years of endless training took their toll on her.</p>
