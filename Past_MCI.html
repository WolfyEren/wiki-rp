<h1>The Missing Children Incident</h1>
   
<p><strong>Recently there was a reported case of 5 children that have gone missing after being reportedly lured into a back room of the pizzeria they were last seen alive at, Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza by an animal mascot from the franchise to gain their trust. The children are as follows, <ins>Eren K</ins>, Lilly F, Gabriel F, Susie C and Cassidy G, ages 18, 18, 15, 14 and 12 respectively. The bodies were never found, but they are all presumed dead. The suspect has been charged, and we hope he gets what he deserves. It also is a sad event considering it matches up with the 7 year anniversary of Marie Twilight’s death, who was 9 at the time of her murder outside Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza.</strong></p>
