<h1>5 Year Anniversary</h1>
   
<p><strong>Today marks the 5 year anniversary of the death of Marie Twilight, who was 9 at the time of her murder. The suspect was never found, but we hope he gets karma one day. Her parents, Karin Twilight and Harold Twilight have reportedly <ins>tried to sell their pizzeria, Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza</ins> after the loss of their daughter. From the scandal of the death, no companies wish to buy the franchise. It is reported that the co-owner and financial manager of the pizzeria William Afton has made a speech about Marie, who he was quite fond of. His speech is as follows:</strong></p> 

<p style="color:red"><del><ins><strong>“I feel so sorry for Harold, his daughter was one of the only things that made his life happy. The news of her death shook us both severely, I was quite fond of Marie. When she’d sit at the pizzeria and watch us work, I could tell she wanted to do it with us. It’s such a shame that she never got that chance. I hope she rests well in her afterlife, she left us too soon.”</strong></ins></del></p>
