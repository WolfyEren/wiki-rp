<h2>Biography</h2>

<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p><strong>Kakage</strong></p>
<p>Considers him a good ally since free rides, even if it is a bit embarassing. Unaware of his death but would probably swear vengence against whoever did it (not like he can hate them any less)</p>

<p><strong>Lucille</strong></p>
<p>Likes Lucille since he gets along well with her and is a good ally to each other. Terrified at her death as he scampers off, leaving her and everybody else behind.</p>

<p><strong>Mason and Terrin</strong></p>
<p>Doesn't think too strongly on them. A bit annoyed that they refuse to work together as a team but can't do much about it.</p>

<p><strong>Gorge</strong></p>
<p>Annoyed by Gorge since he refused to answer any of his questions about his origin. Didn't hesistate to abandon him when Landon killed Lucille</p>

<p><strong>Landon</strong></p>
<p>Unaware of his specific existence but is probably afraid of and hates him after he brutally killed Lucille.</p>

<p><strong>Eren and Sugar</strong></p>
<p>He hates them for stopping his plan and they hate him back for killing their fellow mystics and trying to ban them. Was glad when Sugar got captured as he taunted and hurt her until she gets a hold on him and gets them both shocked to escape.</p>
