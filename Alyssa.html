<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>A Failed actress, probably has stockholm syndrome. Is now an adoptive babysitter/mother to three kids.</p>

<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p><strong>Crystal (Positive) </strong></p>        
<p>Alyssa's favorite adoptive daughter as she causes the least amount of trouble to her. Crystal also looks similar to her so they could pass off as biological family</p>

<p><strong>Kyle (Positive) </strong></p>
<p>Alyssa's adoptive son. She's not as fond as him as the rest but she still loves him just the same. Was often a target of his antics but they're now led by Jenny.</p>

<p><strong>Jenny (Positive) </strong></p>
<p>Alyssa's adoptive daughter. Not really fond of her but she loves her unconditionally. She's often a target of Jenny's pranks and has to keep a constant eye on her before she makes trouble to her siblings.</p>

<p><strong>Eren (Positive) </strong></p>
<p>A good friend to Alyssa after the whole mishap he caused for her. While they don't hangout too much, they seem to have nice chemistry and they care for each other. When Eren was in jail, she personally forced Landon to help her break them out which they successfully did. When Landon accidentally left Eren behind at the police station, she threatened to scratch him non stop if he doesn't get him back. She also helped repair the rift between Eren and Valentine by tricking her into confronting Eren. She may have harbored feelings for him although it's dismissed as stockholm syndrome.</p>

<p><strong>Sugar (Positive) </strong></p>
<p>Alyssa's friend. They don't usually interact although they tend to share the same goals such as getting her and Eren out of jail. She also tagged along to the police station, mainly because of the party and social interaction that isn't children for once.</p>

<p><strong>Ally (Positive) </strong></p>
<p>Val's little sister who is under Alyssa's care at the moment. She doesn't know much about the girl except she conspires with the other girls a lot and she often talks of getting Valentine and Eren together, although she never ever actually tries to do it, much to Alyssa's relief.</p>
    
<p><strong>Lyra (Neutral) </strong></p>
<p>Lyra is Alyssa's acting rival back in drama school. They didn't really get along with each other when it comes to their career but will have some playful banter between each other at times. Lyra eventually ditched acting altogether and became a Magician instead. Alyssa eventually had Eren help enact some revenge on her to which he complied to.</p>

<p><strong>Landon (Neutral) </strong></p>
<p>Not really a friend to Alyssa, although they worked together after some convincing on her end, to break Eren and Sugar out of jail. She gets pissed at him after accidentally leaving Eren behind and threatens to scratch him without stopping.</p>

<p><strong>Lucille (Negative) </strong></p>
<p>Was a 'friend' to Alyssa after she showed up to the door and convinced her to come with her, claiming she could have a chance to get back into acting. The supposed friendship didn't break even after she was brought onto the ship solely because she was still influenced by Lucille. The trust only broke when Alyssa came back to full consciousness and realised what had happened. Safe to say Alyssa hates her guts, like most of the others.</p>
