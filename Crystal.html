<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>I didn't pay child support for you</p>

<h2>Relationships (Based on Strongest)</h2>
<p><strong>Gary</strong></p>
<p>Gary is Crystal's biological father. He's a tiger now. Not much else to say</p>

<p><strong>Kyle</strong></p>
<p>Kyle is Crystal's biological brother. We have finally found his real name using Skype. He is still not relevant though.</p>

<p><strong>Jenny</strong></p>
<p>Jenny is Crystal's adoptive sister. They often play together all the time.</p>

<p><strong>Alyssa</strong></p>
<p>Alyssa is Crystal's adoptive mother. She's often the target of the kids playful antics since they don't really have anybody else to target. I guess Eren would be her adoptive father although they never interact so I'm excluding him</p>

<h2>Trivia/Random Fun Facts</h2>
