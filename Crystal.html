<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>One of the twins Eren and Sugar "rescued" from Gary.</p>

<h2>Relationships (Based on Strongest)</h2>
<p><strong>Gary (Positive)</strong></p>
<p>Gary is Crystal's biological father. He's a tiger now. Not much else to say</p>

<p><strong>Kyle (Positive)</strong></p>
<p>Kyle is Crystal's biological brother. We have finally found his real name using Skype. He is still not relevant though.</p>
    
<p><strong>Ally (Positive)</strong></p>
<p>Ally is Val's little sister, who often calls herself the big sister. She likes her, and has fun playing with her and Jenny. </p>

<p><strong>Jenny (Positive)</strong></p>
<p>Jenny is Crystal's adoptive sister. They often play together on her switch, playing animal crossing mostly.</p>

<p><strong>Alyssa (Neutral)</strong></p>
<p>Alyssa is Crystal's adoptive mother. She's often the target of the kids playful antics since they don't really have anybody else to target. I guess Eren would be her adoptive father although they never interact so I'm excluding him</p>
