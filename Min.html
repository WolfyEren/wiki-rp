When Min's clothes were mysteriously covered in glitter, Eren offered to take off each piece of glitter before Min could murder somebody, to which she was thankful for. They share a heart to heart conversation afterwards where she opens to up to him about how she hates being understood, Eren promised that he'll be there for her as a friend since he's gone through the same thing as well. He tries to stick up for her where he can but there comes a point where force will have to be used.</p>
