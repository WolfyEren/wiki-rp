<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>His parents died at a young age and was put under the care of another trusted werewolf who raised Eren. She taught him the ability to speak to and understand animals. It is unknown what happened to her after the first few years. Maybe try asking Eren about it sometime</p>

<h2>Relationships (Based on Strongest)</h2>
<p><strong>Valentine</strong></p>
<p>Valentine has been Eren's closest friend since his childhood. They first met in elementary when Valentine stood up for Eren against Bullies. They've remained close friends up until graduation when Eren mysteriously "disappeared". Valentine however did not notice his disappearance as she was too busy with work to become a Detective. During his disappearance, he's wondered about Val and if she even knows he's gone (Which she didn't). 4 years after his disappearance (and eventual reappearance), Eren finally reunites with Val after a mishap with mail and they're both shocked and joyed to see each other with both sides oblivious to what really happened. (More to come soon)</p>

<p><strong>Sugar</strong></p>
<p>Sugar is Eren's current adoptive sibling. She's the one who rescued him from his "disappearance" and they now own the Pizzeria together. Out of the two, she is the more easygoing and is thus the one who talks more and represents the Pizzeria as owner. They are shown to both care and support one another despire the trials faced. Eren is the more serious one and usually "handles" the business part on the side. They're practically inseperable and rely on each other for support throughout tough times. They always accompany each other on adventures.</p>

<p><strong>Luna</strong></p>
<p>Luna is Eren's other close friend from high school. They had a tight friend group between Him, Luna, and Valentine lasting up til the end of graduation. However afterwards, Eren disappeared and the group pretty much disbanded. 5 years later, Eren decides to look for Luna with Val and they eventually reunite with her. She's an alcoholic and speculated to be depressed which worries Eren so he does his best to try and hangout with Luna, with the intent to hopefully help her. He is usually uncomfortable with her "close" nature, especially when drunk but he puts up with it for her sake.</p>

<p><strong>Jenny</strong></p>
<p>Jenny is technically Eren's adoptive daughter after he agreed to take her in although Alyssa is the one who takes care of her mostly. He usually brings her gifts from whatever adventure he goes on with the most recent one being a small lab coat from Nicholas. Eren paid child support for her, not Kyle or Crystal.</p>

<p><strong>Grace</strong></p>
<p>Grace was taken in by Eren after she got disowned by her parents (albeit eren was the initial cause) but Grace is fine with it after knowing since she believes that her parents didnt really care for her in the first place. During her subject time, Eren acted as the main cause but also helped and comforted her under his wolf alias of "Wolfy". Hangs out together outside of the RP (in sims)</p>

<p><strong>Min</strong></p>
<p>Min is one of the Chefs that work at the Pizzeria. She's one of the subjects that became a snow leopard mid-fight with a Day guard but was calmed down by Eren and taken in to live at the apartment block. She is often hostile towards the other people living there as they annoy her however Eren tries to keep the peace between them. When she got pranked by Jenny and Jay who put glitter in her laundry, Eren convinced her to stand down and said that he would help her take the glitter out of her clothes. After about 7 hours, they're still at it with a few clothes left, Eren asks about her anger issues and they end up having a heart to heart about their own personal experiences. He states that he'll be there for her as a friend and somebody who respects her, even if the world is against her which causes her to smile a bit for 0.5 seconds. Eren is glad that he didn't ask "Do you like pancakes" instead.</p>

<p><strong>Alyssa</strong></p>
<p>Alyssa was the first "subject" to be taken in to live with the others. Was confused at first but eventually learns to live with it since she doesn't have much to do after her failed acting career. Indicated to may like Eren but might just be stockholm syndrome so subverted. Helped repair the rift between Eren and Val and in return Eren paid a months worth of Child support, for only one of the children. Good luck Eren</p>

<p><strong>Marie</strong></p>
<p>Marie was one of the allies to Eren and Sugar's clan in the Final Fantasy Realm, in the end he convinced her to leave with them through the portal and it turned out she was also from the real world. Decided to stay with them since it's been 6 years and she has no idea what happened to everybody anymore.</p>

<p><strong>Landon</strong></p>
<p>Landon just kinda hates Eren for some reason. Maybe it's cause people like him more because he's "nice". Who knows. Eren just kinda shrugs it off though.</p>

<p><strong>Jay</strong></p>
<p>Jay is annoying and usually (used to) harasses the girls much to Eren's annoyance who tries to keep the peace among everybody. Especially once he targets Val is when things get personal.</p>
