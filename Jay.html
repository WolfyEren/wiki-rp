<h2>Relationships</h2>

<p>Jay's Girlfriend, met her at a coffee shop and they had some good chemistry together, hanging out and playing games together. They eventually got together and became an official couple. Grace was at first tolerant of Jay's pranks but got fed up with it and wished he stopped. She also questions if he truly loves her.</p>

<p><strong>Jenny (Positive) </strong></p>
<p>Jay's accomplice in training, due to her being young he's unable to do certain pranks around her but it seems she already has the making of a true mastermind. He's also worried about what he teaches her due to Eren threatening him with an "or else", and he's not sticking around to see what he does.</p>

<p><strong>Jesse (Positive) </strong></p>
<p>One of the members of Jay's crew. Is currently in Bootcamp training. She hates joycon drifting.</p>

<p><strong>Eren (Negative) </strong></p>
<p>Death Incarnate's big brother</p>

<p><strong>Min (Negative) </strong></p>
<p>A cranky snow leopard that Jay should not have messed with. Probably would've gotten mauled to death.</p>

<p><strong>Mason (Negative) </strong></p>
<p>Jay's older brother, he was secretly a vampire and almost sacrificed Jay or something, Grace came to the rescue and murdered him with a stake. Nobody has pressed charges against her though so I guess she walks free.</p>
